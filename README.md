# COVID-19_Restaurants-R_Final_Project
Final Team Project conducted with Tuty Chau as a part of the Data Science: R - DAT-5302 course by Lawrence De Geest 

## Files & Task
The project consistet of a broad task but included the self-selection of data (data collection), Variable Selection, Data Analysis & Modelling. 

We choose to analyze investigate the impact of Food Safety Violations in Chicago on COVID-19 cases in communities utilizing publicly available information of the City of Chicago. 
The data portal of the city provides access to every food inspection conducted by the cityâ€™s Department of Public Health. Each inspection that is conducted by one of the approximately 30 inspectors is recorded including various identifiers of the business, their risk class, general state (is it out of business etc.), violations found and instructions given to the business based on findings. 

In addition to access to the food inspection data, the city provides dedicated statistics for COVID-19 cases, tests, and deaths by ZIP code. This is of significance as it can be assumed that the data collection, more precisely the location identifiers are correct and align between the two datasets that provide the foundation of the analysis. 

The respective links to each of the datasets and data used are:

* [COVID-19 Data](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/COVID-19-Cases-Tests-and-Deaths-by-ZIP-Code/yhhz-zm2v)
